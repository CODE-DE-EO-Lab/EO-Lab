# EO-Lab
The EO-Lab cloud is part of the Strategy "Artificial Intelligence" of the German Federal Government. It provides German entities for science and development easy and efficient access to earth observation data, a virtual working environment for processing these data, as well as extensive information and training to support users.  EO-Lab promotes the scientific utilisation of data from national EO-missions and from the Copernicus Program as well as the development of efficient, automated process chains and innovative EO-applications. The scientific use of AI-methods is particularly welcome. Developers from both scientific and commercial entities are invited to design and demonstrate new processes and applications on EO-Lab.
